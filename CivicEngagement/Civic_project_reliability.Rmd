## Load Qualtrics survey respones, Prolific demographic data, and census tract datasets

## Merge Qualtrics data with Prolific data: filter out timed-out submissions -> 50 valid submissions awaiting review are left

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load prolific demographic data & census tract data
prolific_demo <- read.csv("prolific_demographics.csv")
census_tract_raw <- read.csv("census_tract.csv")

# Merge Prolific demo
## Change the column name
colnames(prolific_demo)[2] <- "PROLIFIC_PID"
## Merge data
df_raw <- merge(survey, prolific_demo, by="PROLIFIC_PID", all.x=TRUE)

```

### Some demographic questions in Qualtrics overlap with Prolific data: "Age" "Sex (gender)" "Ethnicity.simplified"
### However, there are a few issues
#### Prolific data is slightly different from that of our survey responses: average age 33.88 (Qualtrics) vs 33.98 (Prolific)
#### Expired data is included: coded as DATA_EXPIRED, cf. CONSENT_REVOKED means returned submissions).
#### We don't know what categories are used when collecting demographics: Qualtrics shows Female, Male and Non-binary, but there is no one who identified themselves as non-binary in Prolific data.

### In conclusion, Prolific demographic data is not as accurate as that we collected through our survey.

```{r}
## Check the accuracy of the prolific data
df_raw <- df_raw %>% filter(Status.y=="AWAITING REVIEW")
df_raw$Q3 <- as.numeric(df_raw$Q3)
df_raw$Age <- as.numeric(df_raw$Age)
mean(df_raw$Q3)
mean(df_raw$Age)


df_raw %>%
  group_by(Ethnicity.simplified) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n(),
    Proportion = n() / nrow(df_raw) * 100 
  )
```

## Merge census data

```{r}
# Select necessary columns
census_tract <- census_tract_raw %>% rename(Q55_4=Census.tract.2010.ID)
census_tract<- census_tract %>% select(Q55_4,Identified.as.disadvantaged)
census_tract$Q55_4 <- as.numeric(census_tract$Q55_4)
df_raw$Q55_4 <- as.numeric(df_raw$Q55_4)
df_raw <- merge(df_raw,census_tract,by="Q55_4",all.x = TRUE)
```

## Reliability score interpretation

#### Alpha > 0.9: Excellent reliability.
#### Alpha between 0.8 and 0.9: Good reliability.
#### Alpha between 0.7 and 0.8: Acceptable reliability.
#### Alpha < 0.7: May indicate poor internal consistency



### Q14. In the past year, how frequently have you been involved in the following types of civic participation activities? alpha: 0.76 (acceptable)

```{r}
#alpha output interpretation- https://rpubs.com/hauselin/reliabilityanalysis
Q14 <- df %>% select(Q14_1:Q14_8)
#Q14 <- df[, c("Q14_1", "Q14_2", "Q14_3", "Q14_4", "Q14_5", "Q14_6", "Q14_7", "Q14_8")]
Q14_score <- psych::alpha(Q14)
Q14_score$total
Q14_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q19. Have you ever used any of the following data to support your position or argument when engaging in discussions (with friends or more formally) about public policy? alpha: 0.69 (acceptable)

```{r}
Q19 <- df %>% select(Q19_1:Q19_7)
Q19_score <- psych::alpha(Q19)
Q19_score$total
Q19_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q20. How confident do you feel about using the data or information you have used? alpha: 0.52 (missing data since only people who have used any data answered this question) - not correct

#### There are too many missing values in the responses for Q20 since only the data types each participant used for civic engagement (asked in Q19) were shown in Q20. In other words, items given for participants to answer varied depending on their responses to Q19. It already caused inconsistency in the data and generated many missing values.

#### Despite such issues, I tried calculating Cronbach's alpha with pairwise deletion, but the alpha is 0.52 and a warning message popped up saying the matrix is not positive definite. It may be because the dataframe includes too many missing values (218 out of 378) which represents a weird data structure to calculate Cronbach's alpha. Other alternatives are removing incomplete cases or imputing missing values, but I don't think they are the right options since they will lead to severe data loss.

#### In conclusion, we need to remove the display logic set for Q20 so that all participants can rate the level of their confidence about 7 data types. Otherwise, calculating the reliability score of this question does not make sense.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
Q20 <- df %>% select(Q20_1:Q20_7)
Q20_score <- psych::alpha(Q20, na.rm=TRUE) #pairwise deletion to handle missing values: calculates correlations for each pair of items that have complete data
Q20_score$total
Q20_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q24. To what extent do you agree with the following statements about data relevant to public policy? alpha: 0.50 (if "Concerned about privacy and security when using data" is dropped, 0.69)

```{r}
Q24 <- df %>% select(Q24_1:Q24_5)
Q24_score <- psych::alpha(Q24)
Q24_score$total
Q24_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q24. To what extent do you agree with the following statements about data relevant to public policy? alpha after dropping "Concerned about privacy and security when using data": 0.69 (acceptable)

```{r}
Q24_rev <- Q24[,-2]
Q24_rev_score <- psych::alpha(Q24_rev)
Q24_rev_score$total
Q24_rev_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q28. To what extent do you agree with the following statements? alpha: 0.79 (good)

```{r}
Q28 <- df %>% select(Q28_1:Q28_5)
Q28_score <- psych::alpha(Q28)
Q28_score$total
```

### Q29. To what extent do you agree with the following statements? alpha: 0.67 (if "Data collection practices in my community are fair and transparent" is dropped, 0.68)

```{r}
Q29 <- df %>% select(Q29_1:Q29_4)
Q29_score <- psych::alpha(Q29)
Q29_score$total
```

### Q29. To what extent do you agree with the following statements? alpha after dropping "Data collection practices in my community are fair and transparent": 0.68 (acceptable?)

```{r}
Q29_rev <- Q29[,-1]
Q29_rev_score <- psych::alpha(Q29_rev)
Q29_rev_score$total
Q29_rev_score$alpha.drop
```

### Q30. How concerned are you about the following issues related to data use in civic engagement? alpha: 0.74 (acceptable)

```{r}
Q30 <- df %>% select(Q30_1:Q30_8)
Q30_score <- psych::alpha(Q30)
Q30_score$total
Q30_score$alpha.drop
```
